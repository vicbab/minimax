# there must always be a trifold structure of (game) temporality:
# 1/ past (the n-D determined set of played moves)
# 2/ now (nothing(ness), the current situation -- meaning the _stance_ in which the player [first-hand, embodied, lived perspective], the junction of past and futures (accounting for the possible and the likely))
# 3/ future (derivated from the "Many"ness of the possible worlds... Butterfly effect--Chaos theory. From within the Chaos of the possible arises the Realized, meaning the "what did(would, has, had, AND **WILL** (most probably) happen)")
#       3/1/ This. This is the most complex. The à-venir is yet to come, à-venir, literally, the "yet-to-come". The Probabilistic is extramathematical and must be treated as such. Therefore, an algorithmic in-carn-ation of life(hear "game")world must be:
#               3/1/1/ Embodied
#               3/1/2/ In-the-world
#               3/1/3/ Immediate (almost intuitive-like, as immediate as computational resources can be.)
# the decision arises from a multifactorial situational/situated/lived-as-such/qualitative (qualia-of-the-experience-at-(first-)hand). as such, "free-"will is the _result_ of past, joined with the possible (i.e. the futureS (possible worlds))
# the decision can never be un-emotional, but it HAS to be in order to let objectivity occur. thus, objectivity is non-occuring.
# Difficulty: accounting for the rhizomatic non-thetic and non-arborescent (obviously) sense of time consciousness

# intentional consciousness.
